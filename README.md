# DataLink

DataLink is an IVOA standard which defines mechanisms for connecting data items discovered via one service to related data products and web services.

## Status

The last stable version is
**[REC-1.0](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/DataLink/20150617/index.html)**.

The next version will be 1.1. A **[Proposed Recommendation](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/DataLink/20230413/index.html)** is already available. It is not yet finalized and so, should not be considered yet as stable for operational implementation, however reference implementations are encouraged.
